# Image Processing - Practical Exam

Please make sure to write your code on your own. Be aware of plagirism. It counts as you did not submit any work at all.

## Guidelines
1. Each team has its model to implement correctly.
2. Do not edit any file except "exam.py".
3. Implement in the corresponding function name.
4. It is important to code from scratch, do not use ready-made functions to finish the task, unless its your last resort (option).
5. Using ready-made functions will lower your score.
6. Again, for the people who do not read carefully. Do NOT corrupt other files except "exam.py".
